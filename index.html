                <h4>The Problem</h4>
                <p>
                    The Firefighters Charitable Foundation was intended to provide financial support to people impacted
                    by fire and disaster, prevention programs, and volunteer fire departments. We have observed our
                    website does not provide a local connection for people to get involved, causing users to go to other
                    local organizations.

                    How might we help people connect to their local chapters so they can tangibly see the value of their
                    contributions to others and themselves?

                <h4>Our Solution</h4>
                <p>
                    We believe providing local options and highlighting the positive impacts of donations to people who
                    are interested in getting involved will achieve an increase of contributions to the foundation and
                    thus help more people in need.

                    <h4>User Interviews & Surveys</h4>
                    <p> Starting off, I asked myself a few initial questions. Who is the primary user? What kind of
                        goals do they have? How would someone find this organization? After interviewing seven
                        participants and receiving 25 responses from our Google Survey via LinkedIn later on in the
                        process, it became evident that my initial questions were just the beginning. Our research
                        participants identified two main themes: a connection to local organizations and a simple,
                        tangible way to see the impact of their involvement.</p>
                    <p><b>It surprised us that 77% of those surveyed wanted to support their local organization rather
                            than a national organization. </b> This presented a unique challenge since we chose a
                        national
                        organization!

                <p>We developed Sherrie Carson, a local teacher, to guide us through our redesign. Through our
                    interviews, we iterated Sherrie Carson to better reflect those most impacted by fire disaster.</p>
                <p>Sherrie's focus on her local community shifted how we approached our redesign for the Firefighters
                    Charitable Foundation. We needed to create ties to local fire departments while staying true to our
                    nationally based organization.</p>

                <p>We used affinity mapping to identify not only the general scope of the Firefighters Charitable
                    Foundation, but to decide which direction we wanted to take. This was a form of brainstorming during
                    our research period that proved to be very helpful in setting up the foundation for the rest of our
                    process.</p>
                <p>As we paired down our affinity diagram, the central themes that users kept bringing up were
                    connecting with local organizations and a simple, tangible way to see the impact of their
                    involvement.</p>

                    <h4>Heuristic Evaluation</h4>
                    <p>The Firefighters Charitable Foundation needed some modernization, a refresher on hierarchy, and
                        revamping how users saw the impact of their donations. Based on our research, we also needed to
                        implement a way for users to connect to their local community.
                        As we went through a Heuristics evaluation, our key insights were the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Modernize the aesthetic of the website</li>
                        <li>Alphabetize and simplify navigation categories</li>
                        <li>Create a way for users to get involved on a local level through a national organization</li>
                        <li>Show the impact of donations</li>

                    <h4>User Flow</h4>
                    <p>To better understand how we would construct the core experience for the Firefighter Charitable
                        Foundation, I designed a user flow. <b>The user flow helped my team focus more on the experience
                            and needs of
                            the user and less so on the details that we would solidify later on.</b> It also allowed us
                        to communicate the entries and exits more clearly so we would have a better understanding moving
                        forward. For example, we identified that the only way to donate was to go through AmazonSmile,
                        which
                        took users away from the site.

                    <p>Unpopular opinion, I love to card sort. In card sorting, we found that the only way to digitally
                        donate to the Firefighters Charitable Foundation was by leaving the website and going to
                        AmazonSmile. In our iterated site map, we priortized keeping users on the wesbite and creating
                        two ways to donate within the site itself.</p>

                    <p>Heading into our style guide, we wanted to evoke feelings of dependability. We opted for a
                        classic firefighter red and a charcoal color for our color palette to stick true to our
                        firefighter roots.</p>

                    <p>After some research, we decided to do a mix of illustrations and pictures to convey our story
                        better and help the user engage with the material in a more constructive way.</p>

                    <h4>Wireframes to Mid-Fidelity</h4>
                    <p>One of our biggest challenges while wireframing and prototyping was taking a national
                        organization giving users the opportunity to connect locally. As we moved through low and
                        mid-fidelity, we continually asked ourselves, does this reflect the data we've collected?
                        The two biggest things we learned from prototyping were keeping it simple and consistent.</p>
                    <h4>User Testing</h4>
                    <p>When we conducted our user tests, we received constructive feedback about a lack of consistency
                        with button size and drop shadow as well as comments on our color palette. We also received
                        positive feedback on our Thank You page and the simplicity of the user flow.</p>

                    <p><b>We tested often, failed often, and kept going.</b></p>

                    <p>Our key insights from our low and mid-fidelity prototypes were that users wanted a simple and
                        easy way to “Get Involved” with their community, especially as fire-disaster becomes a more
                        prevalent issue.</p>

                    <p><b>We went from user research to defining and ideating, from wireframes to mid-fi to a heavily
                            iterated high-fi within our three-week time frame.</b></p>

                    <p>For most of us, this was our first time working with each other, and we needed to learn each
                        other's communication, working, and design styles quickly to find a clear path forward. This
                        project was a lesson in collaboration and really highlighted that everyone has something to
                        bring to the table. It was good practice for the real world!</p>

                    <p>For our next steps, I would like to build out mobile to ensure a consistent experience from
                        desktop to mobile.</p>
