                <h4>The Problem</h4>
                <p>
                    The Firefighters Charitable Foundation was intended to provide financial support to people impacted
                    by fire and disaster, prevention programs, and volunteer fire departments. We have observed our
                    website does not provide a local connection for people to get involved, causing users to go to other
                    local organizations.

                    How might we help people connect to their local chapters so they can tangibly see the value of their
                    contributions to others and themselves?

                <h4>Our Solution</h4>
                <p>
                    We believe providing local options and highlighting the positive impacts of donations to people who
                    are interested in getting involved will achieve an increase of contributions to the foundation and
                    thus help more people in need.

                    <h4>User Interviews & Surveys</h4>
                    <p>
                        We conducted seven user interviews and received 25 Google Survey responses via LinkedIn.

                        Our key insights from our user interviews and Google Survey were the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Users prefer to donate to local organizations </li>
                        <li>Users like to connect with trusted organizations that they find through family, friends, and
                            social media</li>
                        <li>The biggest obstacle to volunteering was time</li>
                        <li>Users want to know WHERE their donation is going</li>
                    </ul>
                    <b>It surprised us that 77% of those surveyed wanted to support their local organization rather
                        than a national organization.</b> This presented a unique challenge since we chose a national
                    organization!

                <h4>Proto Persona & User Persona</h4>
                <p>We developed Sherrie Carson, a local teacher, to guide us through our redesign. Through our
                    interviews, we iterated Sherrie Carson to better reflect those most impacted by fire disaster.</p>
                <p>Sherrie's focus on her local community shifted how we approached our redesign for the Firefighters
                    Charitable Foundation. We needed to create ties to local fire departments while staying true to our
                    nationally based organization.</p>

                <h4 {text-align: right;}>I Like, I Wish, What If</h4>
                <p>As we paired down our affinity diagram, the central themes that users kept bringing up were connecting with local organizations and a simple, tangible way to see the impact of their involvement.</p>
